# Help-Ronaldo-Score-the-Goal

In this game you have to move Ronaldo(runner.jpg) towards the goal(goal.jpg) by moving anything in the frame be it your hands or anything. 

You have to also be careful of Pique(tracker.jpg) so that he doesnâ€™t catch you.

Scoring a goal gives you 1 plus point and if Pique catches Ronaldo you lose 1 point.
